## Best Practices

### Data Management

- **Never modify raw data**: Keep original data immutable and document its source
- **Document all data transformations**: Maintain clear records of how processed data was derived
- **Use appropriate formats**: CSV for simple data, Parquet for larger datasets, SQLite for relational data
- **Include a data dictionary**: Document variables, units, and data types
- **Exclude large data files from git**: Add them to `.gitignore` and document how to obtain them

### Code Organization

- **Modularize your code**: Move reusable functions to the `src/` directory
- **Follow a logical workflow**: Number notebooks sequentially to establish clear analysis flow
- **Document as you go**: Include markdown cells explaining your reasoning and findings
- **Keep notebooks focused**: Each notebook should address a specific analysis step
- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Clear, descriptive names for all files and functions

### Reproducibility

- **Track dependencies**: Keep `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` updated
- **Set random seeds**: Ensure reproducibility in stochastic processes
- **Document computational environment**: Note hardware specifications for resource-intensive operations
- **Use relative paths**: Ensure code works regardless of where the repository is cloned
- **Include setup instructions**: Make it easy for others to reproduce your environment

### Version Control

- **Commit frequently**: Make small, logical commits with descriptive messages
- **Use branches**: Create feature branches for major changes or experiments
- **Tag important milestones**: Mark significant versions of your analysis
- **Document significant changes**: Update README with major developments
- **Consider git-lfs**: For version-controlling larger files when necessary

### Documentation

- **Maintain a comprehensive README**: Include project overview, objectives, and setup instructions
- **Document assumptions**: Note any assumptions made during analysis
- **Include interpretation**: Explain the meaning of your results, not just how they were produced
- **Add visualizations**: Use diagrams to explain complex workflows or relationships
- **Link to external resources**: Reference relevant papers, datasets, or related projects

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env` or `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment: `source env/bin/activate` or `conda activate environment_name`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start your analysis by exploring the data in the notebooks directory
